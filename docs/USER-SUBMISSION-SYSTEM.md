# User Submission System

## Overview
The User Submission System allows anyone to add missing dog daycare businesses to WoofSpots. All submissions go through admin review before going live.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Sources
Every business in our database has a `data_source` field:
- **scraped**: Automatically collected from Google Maps (bulk of data)
- **user_submitted**: Added by users, pending or approved
- **user_claimed**: Business owner claimed their listing
- **manual**: Manually added by admin

### 2. Verification Status
Each business has a `verification_status`:
- **unverified**: Scraped data, not yet verified
- **pending**: User submitted, awaiting admin review
- **verified**: Admin approved
- **rejected**: Admin rejected (with reason)

## User Flow

### Submitting a Business

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/submit-business`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Paws Paradise Dog Daycare",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "state": "CA",
  "zipCode": "94102",
  "phone": "(415) 555-1234",
  "website": "https://pawsparadise.com",
  "submitterName": "John Doe",
  "submitterEmail": "john@example.com"
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Thank you! Your submission has been received and will be reviewed shortly.",
  "businessId": 12345
}
```

**Error Response (Duplicate):**
```json
{
  "error": "Business already exists",
  "message": "Paws Paradise Dog Daycare in San Francisco is already in our database.",
  "businessId": 9876
}
```

### What Happens Next

1. **Instant confirmation**: User gets success message
2. **Email confirmation**: Submitter receives email (TODO)
3. **Admin notification**: Admin gets notified of new submission (TODO)
4. **Review queue**: Submission appears in admin dashboard
5. **Approval/Rejection**: Admin reviews and decides
6. **Email notification**: Submitter gets approval or rejection email (TODO)
