### Reddit Posting Tactics

#### **Post Types & Cadence**

**Week 1: Contest Launch**
```
Title: "🐕 New Month, New Dogs Doing Ridiculous Things Contest! $500 Prize"
Subreddits: r/dogs, metro subs
Time: Tuesday 9 AM PST
```

**Week 2: Featured Entry**
```
Title: "Meet [Dog Name], currently winning our photo contest with this ridiculous photo"
Subreddits: r/rarepuppers, r/aww, relevant metro sub
Time: Wednesday 7 PM PST (peak engagement)
Lead with photo, mention contest in post/comments
```

**Week 3: Voting Reminder**
```
Title: "[City] dog owners! Last week to vote in our ridiculous dog photo contest"
Subreddits: Metro-specific subs
Time: Monday 10 AM PST
```

**Week 4: Winner Announcement**
```
Title: "🏆 [Dog Name] wins $500 in our Dogs Doing Ridiculous Things Contest!"
Subreddits: All previously posted subs + r/MadeMeSmile
Time: Sunday 8 PM PST (end of month)
Momentum into next contest
```

#### **Reddit Best Practices**

✅ **DO:**
- Use authentic, conversational tone
- Lead with value (entertainment), then mention contest
- Respond to ALL comments within first hour
- Post during peak times (see schedule below)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Spam same content across multiple subs at once
- Use obviously promotional language
- Ignore subreddit rules (check each before posting)
- Over-post (max 1 post per sub per week)
- Use URL shorteners (Reddit shadowbans these)

#### **Optimal Posting Times (PST)**
- **Monday**: 9-11 AM (fresh week energy)
- **Tuesday**: 9 AM - 12 PM (highest engagement day)
- **Wednesday**: 7-9 PM (evening browsing)
- **Thursday**: 10 AM - 2 PM (mid-week peak)
- **Friday**: 8-10 AM (before weekend mode)
- **Saturday**: 8-10 AM (lazy morning browsing)
- **Sunday**: 6-9 PM (Sunday scaries browsing)

**Avoid**: Friday PM, Monday PM, late nights (low engagement)
